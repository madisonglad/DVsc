# DVsc
DVsc is a computational software to detect and identify viruses from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) or bulk RNA-seq raw data. 
This tool was tested on various scRNA-seq datasets and bulk RNA-seq datasets derived from infected human tissues and cell lines. 
DVsc was tested on a CentOS 7 cluster.
